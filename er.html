<b><h1>ERANAKULAM IS HERE</h1></b>
<u><h2>ABOUT</h2></u>
<p>Sprawling, residential Ernakulam is known for Marine Drive, a busy waterfront promenade where boats offer backwater cruises. The Kerala Folklore and Hill Palace museums explore local heritage through art and antiquities. Shops along Broadway and on MG Road sell fabrics, crafts, and spices, while modern Lulu Mall also has a cinema and an ice rink. Simple eateries serve Keralan specialties and South Indian seafood. </p>
<p>Ernakulam: An amazing paradigm of development & conservation

    Ernakulam bordering the district of Thrissur in the north, Idukki in the East, Alapuzha and Kottayam in the south, Lakshadweep Sea in the west is an amalgam of a hoary heritage and global growth of industry and commerce. For the outside world, Ernakulam is part of Kochi referred to in the history of Kerala as the Queen of Arabian Sea. The densely populated Ernakulam District embodies the achievements of the Kerala State in literacy, industry, trade and commerce. With an inclusive culture, relatively high per capita income and an unstoppable interest of the people in updating themselves of the political, economic, social and cultural happenings in the national and international spheres, Ernakulam represents the high modern phase of the Kerala society.</p>
