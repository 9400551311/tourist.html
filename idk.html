    <h1><b>EXPLORE IDUKKI</b></h1>
    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>Idukki district is a densely forested, mountainous region in the south Indian state of Kerala. In the north, Anamudi mountain towers over Eravikulam National Park, where the rare, blue Neelakurinji flower blooms every 12 years. Nearby, Munnar is a hill station known for its sprawling tea plantations and Tea Museum. Farther south is the vast, curved Idukki Dam and Periyar National Park, a tiger and elephant reserve.</p>
    <p>Idukki (ഇടുക്കി), IPA: [iɖukːi], is a district in the Indian state of Kerala.[4][5] It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two parts.[6] Its division was previously headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and Cheruthoni in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Cardamom Hills of Western Ghats in Kerala.

        Though it is the second-largest district in the region in terms of area, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala. There are only two municipalities in the district and the urban population is comparatively much lower than the rural population.</p>
